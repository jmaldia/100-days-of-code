**Today's Progress**: I worked on rebuilding my portfolio site and blog. I wanted to start blogging along with starting 100 days of code. I used HTML, CSS, jQuery, and BootStrap to build my site. I used WordPress to build the blog. 

**Thoughts:** I thought it would only take me a few hours to work on the site and blog. It took me the whole day. Both site and blog are decent now. I plan on adding some features to it.
