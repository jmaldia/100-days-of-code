**Today's Progress**: Worked on the JS + CSS clock. I'm getting more and more comfortable with CSS. Centering was hard yesterday. It's a little bit easier today. It was also easier to follow JS. 

**Thoughts:** I didn't do much "cheating" today. I still watched the video before starting but after that, I only had to reference it a couple of times. I'm really enjoying myself. I showed it to my daughter and nephew and they thought it was cool. Yea!!!



### Day[1]: 2018-03-09 (Fri) - Drum Kit

**Today's Progress**: I finished learning about semantic tags today and html structure. I also finished building a DrumKit

**Thoughts:** It was hard to just work on JS on my own. I had to walk through with the video to understand what to do next. I was proud of my CSS and HTMl skills though. I was able to build the drum kit site from the ground up.

**Today's Progress**: I worked on rebuilding my portfolio site and blog. I wanted to start blogging along with starting 100 days of code. I used HTML, CSS, jQuery, and BootStrap to build my site. I used WordPress to build the blog. 

**Thoughts:** I thought it would only take me a few hours to work on the site and blog. It took me the whole day. Both site and blog are decent now. I plan on adding some features to it.
