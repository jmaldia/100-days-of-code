**Today's Progress**: I worked on rebuilding my portfolio site and blog. I wanted to start blogging along with starting 100 days of code. I used HTML, CSS, jQuery, and BootStrap to build my site. I used WordPress to build the blog. 

**Thoughts:** I thought it would only take me a few hours to work on the site and blog. It took me the whole day. Both site and blog are decent now. I plan on adding some features to it. 



### Day[1]: 2018-03-09 (Fri) - Drum Kit

**Today's Progress**: I finished learning about semantic tags today and html structure. I also finished building a DrumKit

**Thoughts:** It was hard to just work on JS on my own. I had to walk through with the video to understand what to do next. I was proud of my CSS and HTMl skills though. I was able to build the drum kit site from the ground up. 



### Day[2]: 2018-03-10 (Saturday) - JS + CSS Clock

**Project link(s):** [JS + CSS Clock](http://jonmaldia.com/jscssclock/ )

**Blog Post:** [Day[2] - JSS + CSS Clock ... not a lot of time to do this](https://blog.jonmaldia.com/2018/03/11/day2-jss-css-clock-not-a-lot-of-time-to-this/)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the JS + CSS clock. I'm getting more and more comfortable with CSS. Centering was hard yesterday. It's a little bit easier today. It was also easier to follow JS. 

**Thoughts:** I didn't do much "cheating" today. I still watched the video before starting but after that, I only had to reference it a couple of times. I'm really enjoying myself. I showed it to my daughter and nephew and they thought it was cool. Yea!!!



### Day[3]: 2018-03-11 (Sunday) - Playing with CSS Variables and JS

**Project link(s):** [CSS Variables and JS](http://jonmaldia.com/cssvariableswithjs/ )

**Today's Progress**: Worked on using CSS Variables. I used the variables to be applied on certain properties. I then used JS to change the values of those variables to affect multiple elements. 

**Thoughts:** I think this project was fun. I still had to peek at some of the video and code but I did a lot on my own. I am enjoying myself and learning a lot. 



### Day[4]: 2018-03-12 (Monday) - 

**Project link(s):** No project today

**Blog Post:** [Day[4] – Array Methods
](https://blog.jonmaldia.com/2018/03/13/day4-array-methods/)

**Twitter Post:** [https://twitter.com/jonmaldia/status/973412068664766464](https://twitter.com/jonmaldia/status/973412068664766464)

**Today's Progress**: Today was all about learning. I learned about array methods. I learned this for ruby and it was pretty easy. It's the same for JS but just a bit more verbose. It's pretty awesome. 

**Thoughts:** Gaining more and more confidence.

**Today's Progress**: I am beginning to be more comfortable with working with code. It's like I can find my way around code now. Before, when I would look at code, it feels like a maze that I don't know the entrance to. So, I look at it and just walk away. Now, I go head on. 

**Thoughts:** Today was a great day. I have a revelation and at the same time, I made my wife happy by completing her site.
